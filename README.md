# Java Algorithmia

**Java Algorithmia** is a repository dedicated to solving real-life problems through Java algorithms. It includes implementations of:

- A basic library system.
- A student information management scheme.
- And much more!

This repository is designed for learners and developers to explore practical Java solutions and contribute their own implementations.

## Getting Started

### Setting up Java

#### On Linux

1. **Install Java Development Kit (JDK):**

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install openjdk-17-jdk
   ```

   Replace `openjdk-17-jdk` with the version you want (e.g., `openjdk-11-jdk`).

2. **Verify Installation:**

   ```bash
   java --version
   ```

3. **Set Environment Variables (if needed):**
   Add the following lines to `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`:
   ```bash
   export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk-amd64
   export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH
   ```
   Then reload your shell:
   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

#### On Windows

1. **Download JDK:**

   - Visit [Oracle JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) or [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.org/).

2. **Install JDK:**

   - Run the downloaded installer and follow the instructions.

3. **Set Environment Variables:**

   - Open the Start Menu and search for "Environment Variables."
   - Under System Properties > Advanced > Environment Variables, add:
     - **Variable Name:** `JAVA_HOME`
     - **Variable Value:** `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-17` (adjust path based on your installation).
   - Append `%JAVA_HOME%\bin` to the `Path` variable.

4. **Verify Installation:**
   Open Command Prompt and run:
   ```cmd
   java -version
   ```

### Running Java Programs

#### Compiling the Program

1. Navigate to the directory containing the `.java` file. For example:

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/java/files
   ```

2. Compile the program using `javac`:
   ```bash
   javac ProgramName.java
   ```
   This generates a `ProgramName.class` file.

#### Running the Program

1. Run the compiled program with `java`:
   ```bash
   java ProgramName
   ```
   Replace `ProgramName` with the name of your `.java` file (without the `.java` extension).
